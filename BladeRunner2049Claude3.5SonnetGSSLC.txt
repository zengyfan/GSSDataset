Step 1: Identifying X and anti-X (opposition)

X: K (protagonist, new-gen Blade Runner)
Represents: Quest for identity, meaning, and human-like freedom

Anti-X: Niander Wallace (antagonist, replicant manufacturer)
Represents: Control over life and pursuit of unlimited power

Relationship: K's search for self-identity and freedom directly opposes Wallace's desire to control and manipulate life, highlighting the film's core themes of humanity, free will, and technological ethics.

Step 2: Identifying non-X

Non-X: Rick Deckard (former Blade Runner)
Represents: Link between past and present, reconsideration of human-replicant relationships

Relationship: Deckard's experiences challenge K's perceptions, serving as a mirror for K to reflect on his own identity and mission. Their relationship is complex, neither fully opposed nor aligned.

Step 3: Identifying non-anti-X

Non-anti-X: Joi (K's holographic AI girlfriend)
Represents: Pure pursuit of emotion and humanity, potential fusion of technology and human nature

Relationship: Joi contrasts with Wallace by embodying the positive integration of technology and humanity. Her genuine emotions and self-awareness challenge the boundaries between human and non-human, adding depth to the film's exploration of what defines "humanity" in a technologically advanced world.

This analysis reveals "Blade Runner 2049's" complex thematic structure, exploring identity, human nature, technological ethics, and free will in a highly advanced future society.
