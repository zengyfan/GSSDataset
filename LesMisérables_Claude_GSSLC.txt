Step 1: X vs. Anti-X (Opposition)
X: Jean Valjean - Represents redemption and sacrifice
Anti-X: Javert - Represents absolute law and order
Relationship: Valjean and Javert are in strong opposition. Valjean embodies personal redemption through sacrifice, challenging traditional legal and moral concepts. Javert represents an inflexible legal system, believing criminals cannot reform. Their conflict illustrates the tension between individual conscience and societal norms.
Step 2: Non-X
Non-X: The Thénardiers - Represent selfishness and greed
Relationship: The Thénardiers contrast with Valjean but aren't in direct opposition. They embody selfishness and greed, contrasting Valjean's selflessness. Their actions, while not illegal, lack morality, highlighting Valjean's noble character.
Step 3: Non-Anti-X
Non-Anti-X: Bishop Myriel - Represents mercy and forgiveness
Relationship: Bishop Myriel isn't opposed to Valjean but catalyzes his redemption. The Bishop's mercy contrasts with Javert's strict law enforcement. His forgiveness changes Valjean's life, challenging traditional legal views and demonstrating the power of kindness to awaken goodness in others.
